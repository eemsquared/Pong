# Pong
MP4 of ComSci 22


          -----Game Description / Mechanics-----
Pong is an implementation of the classic game Ping Pong.
Very easy and fun game.
Two player scheme: User VS User
Player 1 uses the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys. (Located at the bottom part of the screen)
Player 2 uses the A and D keys. (Located at the top part of the screen)
First player to get three points wins the game.
A player gets a point if their opponent was not able to "catch" or hit the ball back.
Every point earned, the game will prompt a message indicating for the next round.
Every round, the ball will be set back to its original position. As well as its speed.
To make the game challenging, the speed of the ball will increase everytime it hits any of the racquets.
Scoreboard is also present for each player.

          -----------------------------------
Game appearance is quite simple. I set the background to black and the sprites (ball & racquets) to white. The design is quite minimalistic but it works for me. (LOL)


        -----UPDATES / RECOMMENDATIONS-----
1: Should have used 1 class for the racquets instead of 2
2: Much better audios (haha)
3: Bigger screen
4: Include power ups
